# Security Policy

This security policy applies to the repositories own by @Edditoria on Github and Gitlab. I take all security issues seriously. I appreciate your efforts to improve the repositories.

## Reporting

**DO NOT CREATE ISSUE** to report a security bug or a privacy issue. Instead, please:

- Notice me by email to <edditoria@gmail.com> but **don't** write about any details. Just tell me which repository is having a security issue.
- I would prepare Signal app to chat in end-to-end encryption, or/and add you as security collaborator if need.

## Comments on This Policy

If you have questions and suggestions, please contact me. Thanks!
