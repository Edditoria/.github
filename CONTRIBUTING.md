## Submitting a pull request

### Fork and Pull Model

1. Fork and clone my repository to yours.
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`. **Meaningful branch name** is good, e.g. new feature called "awesome feature": `feat-awesome-feature`, fix bug in magic-function: `fix-magic-function`.
1. Work on your code... (Thanks!!)
1. Make sure the tests still pass. Depends on the project, there may be vary commands available, e.g. `npm run test` for node project.
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request. Remember that you should **submit your feature branch**, e.g. `feat-awesome-feature`, `fix-magic-function`, etc. Highly recommend **enabling "Allow edits from maintainers"**.
1. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

### Proposing Small Change

Sometimes you may want to fix a typo, or do a small change that doesn't need a test, you can **propose file change** directly.
